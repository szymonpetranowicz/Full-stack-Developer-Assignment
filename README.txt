1. Requirements 

Everything is actually setted up in code. All you need to do is just download files, and run basic.html locally.

2. Steps to run

Like I said, just download all files and run local. I didn’t use any database, everything is stored in code.


I’m not really into writing readme files. I’d like to point out that, unfortunately, I didn't figure out how to sort columns.
To be honest I started learning java a week ago because of final exams. I’m sure that I could do much more, if I get more time. 
Hopefully that project is enough to prove that I’m a fast learner and I really care about this job.

After every update or delete in console log, appears object rows, within all versions of notes.

Best regards
